# Per Scholas Full-stack React: Course Pre-work

## Overview
This pre-work will help you prepare for the course and refresh your skills. The course will move at a fast pace, so, the more pre-work you can do, the better you'll do in the course and the more you will get out of it.

**This pre-work is also a great chance to boost your grade!! Participation counts, and completing all of the pre-work assignments will count towards 5% of your total grade.**

Most of all, it will get you back in the swing of coding!

## Setup

The only thing you need to do the pre-work are a computer, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

**Click on the links above for installation instructions for all operating systems.**

Visual Studio Code has some great remote collaboration tools and is the recommended editor for the course. Google Chrome is the industry standard tool for doing frontend development work, and you will be required to use it and it's Chrome Developer tools during the course.

# Assignments
## Create your Homepage!
A hompage is a great professional asset for any software developer, and for anyone working in tech. You are going to create a [static webpage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#web_page) as your own homepage using HTML and CSS.

**Among other assignments, you will continue to develop this portfolio page over the course and will launch it for the world to see.**

This site will be a part of your professional portfolio and a great asset in helping you develop your career.

### Instructions
1. Create a file named `index.html`. It should look [like this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&ssr=false#overview):

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is the skeleton of your homepage. In Google Chrome, open your `index.html` file. The `File > Open` command will bring up a dialog window you can use - double-clik on your file to open it.

**Every time you change this file, you will have to refresh your browser window to see the changes!**
